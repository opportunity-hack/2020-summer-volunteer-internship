# Read this first
If you decide to help support non-profits by working on Opportunity Hack this summer, you need to be made aware of a few things.

0. Opportunity Hack is run by volunteers who have full-time jobs.  We'll be making time to help you this summer.
1. This is the first time we're doing this.
2. We're doing this to provide experience and education over the summer for students who may have had difficulty in finding internships, either because they couldn't find one or because it was [cancelled](https://github.com/gcreddy42/hiring2020).
3. There is no guarantee that you'll receive a job from the work you do with this internship.
4. All of the work you do will be publicly available (i.e. Slack, GitHub, demos will be recorded and published on YouTube) for any employer and for you to put in your portfolio.  Ideally the effort you put in is equal to your chances for success in the future.
5. We cannot offer official letters of employment (if you are on a visa) as we are a group of people who volunteer our technology-focused minds to help non-profits.  You'd be joining us in our guild.  Hopefully by the same time next year we'll have an official non-profit and we can help with letters of employment.  This is not an unpaid internship, this is you volunteering your time over the summer.

# Outcomes
## Your benefit
By working on an Opportunity Hack project over the summer, you'll not only be helping your community, but you'll learn these skills:
1. Learn GitHub
2. Agile - sprints, demos, planning
3. Write code
4. Work with a team

Some other things:
1. Public proof of your work for your portfolio
2. A document that describes the work you put in this summer
3. A recommendation for above-and-beyond effort

## Our benefit
1. We'd love to prove that a virtual summer project can work
2. Continued work on meaningful projects we have identified for non-profits
3. Making connections with you

# Projects
These projects come from our years of experience working with non-profits, we sought to generalize the problems we see in order to impact many non-profits, so although you'll see a few called out, we intend for these solutions to be used at scale, globally, at a relatively inexpensive price point.


## 1. Digitize Paper Forms
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack Channel: `#2020-vol-intern-digitize-paper-forms`

Non-profits are using paper forms.  The cost to digitize these forms to an HTML form in order to integrate it into their existing systems is difficult.  Google Forms is great, yes, but it still requires some effort and knowledge without allowing integration with existing software applications.  We have been working with ASU on two senior capstones around this problem that we can leverage as a head start.

### Requirements
1. You'll be given an [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) ML model (from our work with ASU)
2. You'll be given two images of paper forms
3. Given the bounding boxes output from the ML model, the solution shall create an HTML-based form for each image
4. The solution shall handle additional images in the future
5. The solution shall store the data submitted in the form
6. The solution shall be deployable via 1-button click with a service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## 2. Simple Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR)
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack Channel: `#2020-vol-intern-simple-ehr`

Some non-profits have "clients" that require demographics and treatment to be tracked easily.  This usually requires some scheduling component as well as a historical record of visits with services provided, then reports follow.  There are open-source EHR solutions on the internet, but none are simple enough for non-profits to use without dedicated training.
### Requirements
1. The solution shall allow for clients to register for the system, using Google Single Sign-on or system-based account creation
2. The solution shall record "treatments": medicine provided, music session, painting
3. The solution shall allow for role-based access: 
4. The solution shall log an audit record of activity
5. The solution shall be secure: (1) no security violations for packages, (2) strong authentication
6. The solution shall use an existing framework (e.g. [Django](https://hackernoon.com/configure-role-based-access-control-in-django-74fa94a54aff)) that offers authentication and role-based access.
7. The solution shall allow for data to be import via CSV including patient records and schedule
8. The solution shall be deployable via 1-button click with a service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## 3. Client Relationship Manager (CRM)
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack Channel: `#2020-vol-intern-crm`

This is the sister to the Lightweight EHR project above.  Instead of tracking health and progress of clients, non-profits typically do this with Excel or Google Forms and also manually integrate into DonorPerfect and other non-profit platforms.  SalesForce is the obvious leading solution here, [but still charges non-profits for use](https://www.salesforce.org/nonprofit_product/nonprofit-editions-pricing/).  Platforms like [SuiteCRM](https://suitecrm.com/) or [SpiceCRM](https://www.spicecrm.io/) and [various open-source platforms](https://blog.capterra.com/free-and-open-source-crm/) are available, but non-profits don't have IT support right next to them, they need something simple and cost-effective.  A big part of this is making different external systems integrate with this CRM (e.g. DonorPerfect + SpiceCRM), but this work will be optional for this summer project.

### Requirements
1. The solution shall cost less than $30 per month to run
2. The solution shall be deployable using Heroku or any other one-click deployment platform
3. Ideally you will compare at least 3 different open-source CRM products on the market today and provide this analysis
4. For the best solution you select, provide documentation and a video walkthrough (on YouTube) of how a non-profit would add/remove donors, volunteers, clients.
4. For the best solution you select, provide documentation and a video walkthrough of how a non-profit would track volunteer hours within the CRM
5. For the best solution you select, provide documentation and a video walkthrough of how a non-profit would report on volunteer hours on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly basis.  Ideally a non-profit would be able to see data that shows the engagement (in terms of hours volunteered) from their volunteers
6. For the best solution you select, provide documentation and a video walkthrough of how a non-profit would report on money donated on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly basis.  Ideally a non-profit would be able to see data that shows the donation amounts from their donors.  It would be ideal if you could also report on the amount of donations from all zipcodes within the CRM.
7. For the best solution you select, provide documentation and a video walkthrough of how a non-profit would report on the number of animals adopted each month.
8. For the best solution you select, provide documentation and a video walkthrough of how a non-profit would import a CSV of customers/clients/donors into the platform.
9. Optionally determine if it would be possible to integrate DonorPerfect with the best solution for a CRM you select.
10. Optionally determine if it would be possible to integrate the best CRM you select with any donation/payments (e.g. Square, PayPal, etc.) platform so that donor data could be synchronized or imported from that platform.
11. Optionally determine how a non-profit could update their website to interact with your selection for the best CRM, where the non-profit could have a new-user registration form on their website that would store new registration data within the CRM.

- Both [Lost Our Home Pet Rescue](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/Arizona/issues/11) and [Tranquility Trail Animal Sanctuary](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/Arizona/issues/34) were looking for this in 2018, but many non-profits need to be able to organize their donors, volunteers, clients in a single location.
- In 2015, [Seed Spot](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/Arizona/issues/4) needed a CRM to track and communicate with alumni more effectively.

## 4. Risk Scoring
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack Channel: `#2020-vol-intern-risk-scoring`

Non-profits need a way to vet the standing of people, specifically for pets, as they want to be sure they are going to a nice home.  Given a social media profile (and potentially their network) that someone has granted access to, analyze the content of their posts to create a risk score to understand if there are any red flags for pet adoption.
### Requirements
1. The solution shall collect posts and bio information from Facebook or Twitter
2. The solution shall provide a high risk score for accounts that use terms that indicate violence, hate, animal cruelty, and malice -  this likely means that you will be looking for accounts that already exhibit this, or you can create mock accounts to validate and test the scoring methodology
3. The solution shall be deployable via 1-button click with a service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
4. The solution shall provide a URL that a non-profit can send to a potential animal adopter.  This potential animal adopter will use this URL to sign into either Facebook and Twitter to allow this application to collect data as stated above in order to collect data that may not be publically available per privacy settings the user has provided
5. The solution shall not store data from the person's Facebook or Twitter account that is not private
6. The solution shall store the risk score along with the URL that was provided to the potential animal adopter

## 5. Volunteer registration and tracking
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack Channel: `#2020-vol-intern-volunteer-registration-and-tracking`

There are a ton of non-profits that want to allow volunteers to register on their website.  Registration and signup is not new, and there is room to standardize how non-profits collect registrant data.  Volunteers and clients have a need to create an account in order to allow the non-profit to offer services or ask for help from them.  Once a volunteer is registered, they help the non-profit and their efforts need to be tracked so that the non-profit and the person can understand their contributions, for personal benefit, but also for tax reasons. 

### Requirements
Instead of trying to build a system to do this, we want to perform market research to recommend a system for all non-profts to use.  We think that a platform should already exist, but we are counting on you to weigh all of these requirements and perform a [gap analysis](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/gap-analysis-template/) to tell us if we should build a system to do this, or if one (or maybe two systems that are well integrated) already exist.

1. Be able to list times available for volunteers along with location and duration of request
2. Be able to specify skill that is needed (e.g. painting, drywall, electrical, math tutor, etc.).  Consider this to be a preference that the volunteer specifies when they sign up.  This may also include the opposite (volunteers specifically do not want to volunteer for certain things).
3. Increase communication between NPO and volunteers to increase engagement.  This might be to remind a volunteer of an upcoming event, or to thank a volunteer for helping.  Ideally this would be over text, email, or Facebook Messenger.
4. Be able to find volunteer opportunities in a region.  For example, find all volunteering opportunities for [Children's Cancer Network](https://www.childrenscancernetwork.org/) in zip code 85044.
5. Be able to find opportunities that are good for families. For example, if a family wants to bring their 10 year-old and their 15-year old - ensure that the event indicates that this is okay or even recommended.
6. Recommend volunteer opportunities based on previous experience.  For example, if someone has previously volunteered to help paint a home, and a new opportunity for painting a home is entered, recommend the same people for this volunteering opportunity and notify them that it is available. 
7. Provide written documentation (either in GitHub or a public Google Doc) as well as a video (on YouTube) walkthrough of your findings.

## 6. Intelligent Donation Platform
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack channel: `#2020-vol-intern-intelligent-donations`

Donations are a key resource for non-profits, the more funds that can be raised, the better.  We need to dig deep with this one and look for engineering methods to increase recurring donations or volume of donations.  This project is very open-ended and will require some research into human behavior as well as prototyping some software that may not exist yet.  After spending some time researching what is out there, see if you see a gap and either prototype it, write code, or write out your thoughts.

Some ideas:
1. Recommend other items to donate: if someone donates a TV, ask if they also have shoes to donate
2. Cluster similar donors together to determine alternative marketing methods that may be more effective within the cohort
3. Automate marketing to automatically share, on a monthly basis, a photo posted to social media overlayed with the number of people helped or the number of animals saved over the previous month
4. Survey your local network to understand if they donate to non-profits, why they donate, and what would get them to donate more
5. Look at modern methods of donation - could a non-profit use a combination of Twitch and Patreon?
6. How effective are crowd-funding (e.g. Indiegogo) platforms and raising money for non-profits?
7. Can you automate signup for a non-profit so that a Kiva.org account is created along with several other fundraising platforms?

### Requirements
1. Just like with other projects, if you're writing code, store it in GitHub
2. Create documentation along with a video walk-through (posted on YouTube) of your solution

### References
1. [9 Magic Words that Increase Donations for Nonprofits](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/magic-words-that-increase-donations/) talks about the wording that is used
2. [7 Simple Ways To Increase Donations For Your Nonprofit](https://www.johnhaydon.com/increase-donations-nonprofit/) talks about various methods including sharing outcomes and marketing

4. [NeonCRM](https://www.neoncrm.com/) is apparently awesome, is that something that is easy to use that all non-profits can use?

## 7. Inventory management system
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack channel: `#2020-vol-intern-inventory`

A large set of non-profits that would benefit from a solution here are food pantries (note the difference between [a food bank and a food pantry](https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-blog/what-difference-between-food-bank-and-food-pantry)).  There are large food pantries who likely have all of the software they need (including an integration with [Link2Feed](https://www.link2feed.com/)), but most of the smaller food pantries won't have everything they need, but still need to provide food for their client base.  An effective, free, solution here will benefit many food pantries.  

The general solution you are solving is: given a certain inventory that could be spread across many different buildings, how can a non-profit know what inventory is available in near-real-time (within 2 minutes of an item being added or removed).

### Requirements
1. Your solution should have proper documentation and a video walkthrough of how to use it posted to YouTube
2. Your solution may re-use any existing open-source solutions, and can be custom tailored to one of the non-profits listed in the references section
3. Your solution shall be deployed using a one-click platform like Heroku
4. Your solution may or may not require a mobile app, if you go down the barcode route, remember that most computers have a webcam these days.  By not having a website + mobile app, you reduce the complexity in your solution.
5. If you want to go down the food pantry route, we'd recommend you look at [Pantry for Good](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/pantry-for-good).  Even though no pull requests have been accepted in over a year, there are many forks that may have newer content.  Fixing a few bugs or improving this code-base alone would be great.


### References
- [Matthew's Crossing Food Bank](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/Arizona/issues/9) received many Opportunity Hack solutions over the years to the point where they likely don't have any more problems to solve.  Unfortunately, these custom solutions cannot be generally applied to other food pantries.  If you review these solutions and can integrate one or all into Pantry for Good, that would be a win.

## 8. Notification system
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack Channel: `#2020-vol-intern-notifications`

For Opportunity Hack 2018, [Children's Cancer Network](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/Arizona/issues/8) used Constant Contact, but was missing a mechanism to text clients to ask for them to RSVP, gather how many people responded to a given survey, and wanted to have a simple method to reach out. A great solution [Easy Message](https://devpost.com/software/easy-message) and we would love to see this push into production so that more non-profits can benefit from it.

### Requirements
0. The solution shall re-use the code provided by the Easy Message team's submission from Opportunity Hack 2018
1. The solution shall be one-click deployable using Heroku
2. The solution shall prompt for Twilio API information only on first startup
3. The solution shall implement single sign-on security using Google (or Facebook) single sign-on, so that only specific users are able to login
4. The solution shall include a demo video walkthrough of how to use the product so that non-profits will be able to use the system

### References
- The team's DevPost submission is [here](https://devpost.com/software/easy-message)
- Although the main code is in GitHub [here](https://github.com/2018-Arizona-Opportunity-Hack/Team19) you'll need to check the [forks](https://github.com/2018-Arizona-Opportunity-Hack/Team19/network/members) as some code there looks to be more updated in the forks.
- Another solution [from Team 9 in 2018 is here](https://devpost.com/software/team9) for reference as well.


## 9. Data Analysis
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack Channel: `#2020-vol-intern-data-analysis`

### 9.1 Analyze trends to recommend areas of STEM focus
For Opportunity Hack 2019, [RealTimeSTEAM](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/Arizona/issues/36) was looking for a way to analyze data on the web in order to provide their own staff, along with teachers and parents a better way to introduce [STEAM](https://theconversation.com/explainer-whats-the-difference-between-stem-and-steam-95713) concepts to children.  If there was a way to intersect popular culture with science and technology, as these things evolve, it would provide new educational ideas.
#### Requirements
1. Only use the free API versions of associated websites
2. This solution shall provide a YouTube walkthrough of how to use this product
3. This solution shall overlay popular culture with STEAM lessons for high school and specifically target ages 15 and 16, both male and female
4. This solution shall understand current popular culture using IMDB, Twitter, Twitch, Google Trends, YouTube, [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), Reddit, and Wikipedia.  This is a giant list, so start with one area before trying to add another data source
5. Given a STEAM-related search word (e.g. gravity), the system shall output popular culture trends (e.g. movies, wikipedia pages, popular Tweets/Twitch streams/YouTube videos) that relate to the given STEAM-related word.
6. When the application first loads, it should provide a list of STEAM-curriculum filtered by age (either 15 or 16 with the default filter set to both ages 15 and 16).  Next to each STEAM-curriculum item the application shall provide any recent popular culture references that relate to that STEAM-curriculum item.
7. We'd expect to see some relationship to STEAM topics on physics (e.g. gravity) to the movie [Up](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/) or fluid dynamics related to [The Little Mermaid](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097757/)
8. "Recent" popular culture trends shall be defined as the last 2 years
9. This solution could also use historical popular culture as a dataset.  These would need to be racially and gender diverse (e.g. topics for "space" include both Sally Ride and Neil Armstrong, concepts around food and agriculture would include George Washington Carver and Cyrus McCormick).
10. This solution shall consider all genders and demographics as best as possible, we want all types of children 15 and 16 years old to have something they can relate to, so we don't want this to be built for specific groups.



#### References
- You'll see that Team 6 ([DevPost submission](https://devpost.com/software/team-6-o75mv0) / [Code](https://github.com/2019-Arizona-Opportunity-Hack/Team-6)) did some awesome work in this space, including a complete Heroku deployment.  Create a free Heroku account and try to deploy this app so you can test it out.  Once deployed, enter a STEM-related search term to see the wordcloud output.
- Use the power of Google to find STEAM topics for kids ages 15 and 16, [here is one example](https://www.teachengineering.org/curriculum/browse?collection=Lessons).  You'll use this as the core mechanism to relate popular culture references back to STEAM topics
- Understand that [most girls lose their interest in STEAM at age 15](https://redtri.com/this-is-the-exact-age-when-girls-lose-interest-in-math-and-science/)
- Read [New study suggests STEM education needs a rebrand](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/new-study-suggests-stem-education-needs-a-rebrand/466313345) to understand why we need popular culture references to make STEAM look cool.
- Check out [Among high school seniors, interest in science varies by race, ethnicity](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/04/among-high-school-seniors-interest-in-science-varies-by-race-ethnicity/) to understand the STEM challenges across demographics

### 9.2 Allow non-profits to print forms, collect responses, scan them and easily analyze the data
This one is pretty straightforward.  We'd like to take an existing winning idea and scale it for other non-profits to use. Some non-profits cannot afford tablets or don't want to go through the trouble of emailing/texting forms, they would still rather use a combination of paper and digital forms.  This solution hopefully bridges this gap a little more effectively than requiring a human to review paper forms.
#### Requirements
- Productionalize [Survey Stack](https://devpost.com/software/survey-stack) from Opportunity Hack 2018 ([GitHub code](https://github.com/2018-Arizona-Opportunity-Hack/Team7) | [PowerPoint Presentation](https://1drv.ms/p/s!Ap-vzKL-zTy9t2QmDqAUkrEspB3E)) for [Animals and Humans in Disaster Inc.](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/Arizona/issues/35), [RealTimeSTEAM](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/Arizona/issues/36), and [NMTSA](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/Arizona/issues/31)
- The solution shall use Heroku and shall be deployable in a single click from the project's GitHub
- The solution shall be usable by at least 3 different non-profits, but the data shall not be co-mingled.  Each non-profit will spin up their own Heroku instance
- The solution shall email a provided email address provided during Heroku spin-up when a new form is submitted
- The documentation provided for this solution shall include a video demo walkthrough of how to use the solution
- The documentation provided for this solution shall include the forms used as part of the demo

### 9.3 Social Injustice Index
Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now that may only mitigate a portion of the problem instead of using a strategic long-term approach that would take longer and endure the test of time. Larger corporations accumulate technical debt in various ways. Over time, tech debt becomes known through fail points in the system: latency goes up, reliability goes down, or changes and deployments take longer to complete. Companies must address tech debt with a focused group of people to resolve latency. This typically works well, but as time passes, the same issue can surface again.  

With social injustice, we see the same pattern. In the case of latency, a mature organization will put measurement and attribution in place to ensure that any skew in latency is quickly discovered and resolved. With social injustice, the solution is more abstract and less concrete. One goal would be to develop and maintain a social injustice index based on data surrounding social issues by leveraging current events from multiple media outlets, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, along with Google Trends. This would allow for some measurement to be performed at the state and national level so that trends and magnitudes across localities could be examined objectively through a data driven lens.

#### Requirements
1. Select either a method of obtaining media documents, in America, since the year 2000, or a mechanism to acquire public social media information
2. Provide a social injustice index that ranges from 0 to 100 where 100 is extreme social injustice and 0 is no record of social injustice
3. Calculate this index on a daily basis for the previous day in an automated fashion
4. Backfill this calculation ideally since 2000, but at least for the last 10 years
5. Chart this index as an overall score for the United States of America
6. Chart this index as a score at the state level, ideally you collect enough information from each state to be able to do this, but to make things easier as an MVP, try to do this for at least 5 randomly-selected states.
7. Ensure the code you write is available in our public GitHub
8. Allow for this to be ran by a single click using a platform like Heroku

## 10. Recommend the best website platform for non-profits to use
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack channel: `#2020-vol-intern-best-website-platform`

This project only requires significant research in this space, you'lll need to create (free/trial) accounts, Google your heart out, and document your analysis of the various options available for non-profits to use.  Instead of surgically repairing various websites, we would instead like to recommend a platform that non-profits can use.  We'd then use Opportunity Hack to work with them to move their content to this platform that you recommend.
### Requirements
1. A proper solution shall cost less than $20/month
2. A solution shall allow for SEO to be configured and updated easily (ideally with no user input)
3. A solution shall allow for non-profits to easily link to their social media accounts
4. A solution shall allow for their social media accounts to easily link to specific posts on their website (e.g. you press "share" on the website and are able to make a Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn post)
5. A solution shall allow non-profits to change content easily
6. A solution shall allow non-profits to easily configure donations
7. A solution shall allow for proper security (e.g. using Google SSO or Facebook SSO for ease of use and increased security instead of maintaining security within the website)
8. A solution shall provide significant documentation and various platforms and a cost/benefit analysis and comparison between products.  It may be useful to develop a scoring system in various categories so that you can clearly show the winner in this manner.
9. Uncached page load times shall be less than or equal to 3 seconds - [ref](https://www.criticalcase.com/blog/what-is-page-load-time-and-why-it-is-important.html)
10. You should research at least 8 different alternative platforms, but no more than 20.

## 11. Create the new OpportunityHack.io
#Ô∏è‚É£ Slack channel: `#2020-vol-intern-opportunityhackio`

We use [opportunity-hack.org](http://opportunity-hack.org/) to discuss our annual, global hackathons.  As we continue to create solutions that all non-profits can use, we want to build out the NPOaaS (Non-proft as a service) platform on opportunityhack.io.  This website will allow any non-profit to:
1. Find all relevant solutions we've created for them
2. Find recommendations for other solutions currently available along with our seal of approval recommending that they use them (because we've already tried them out)
One key thing that limits productivity of non-profits are separate systems that are not connected to one another.  While an existing solution may work for them initially, over time they will likely save cost and time by moving to an opportunityhack.io solution that combines many solutions into one platform.
### Requirements
0. [Be sure to read this padlet](https://padlet.com/gregvannoni/c9gopoit4i1aku59) that illustrates the end-goal of all of these projects: opportunityhack.io.
1. This solution shall use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify (free tier)](https://www.netlify.com/).  We normally don't lock solutions down to specifics, but in this case, we'd like this to be the technology for our solution.
2. This solution will give you autonomy and artistic license to create this website as you see fit.  Please check out our previous images [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/opportunityhack) and [opportunity-hack.org](http://opportunity-hack.org) to get a feel for what we already have as a good foundation for your creation.
3. This solution shall have its code stored in GitHub (just like all of the rest of the projects, but extremely important for us so that we can move what you've built over to opportunityhack.io).
4. opportunityhack.io shall have various sections as outlined in the above projects (for instance, "Digitize Paper Forms"). As background for you, these solutions will be provided as open-source, and also should be deployed with one-click using Heroku.  We will provide documentation, GitHub links, Heroku links, and a video walkthrough for each solution.  In the future, non-profits will be able to combine solutions together (e.g. CRM + notifications or Inventory Management + additional data analysis).
5. This solution may have mocked out Heroku and user screens that show how a non-profit would interact with this website.  Although we don't yet have this platform built, we would still love to have some help laying the foundation for what we think opportunityhack.io could be.

## 12. Virtual Fundraisers
COVID-19 has people staying home and away from groups of people, so avenues like fundraisers are unable to be a stream of income for non-profits.  We need innovative ideas that will get people to donate virtually and online that hopefully also have a viral or gamification element to get people engaged.

### Requirements
0. Like all of the other projects, your code needs to be publically available in GitHub with your project deployed using Heroku (or similar) so that people can use what you have built.
1. Most states disallow the concept of a lottery for fundraising, do not create a lottery system as this will likely be illegal.
2. Provide a demo video that walks people through what you have built.
3. Ensure that there is documentation and ease of setup for a non-profit to be able to set this up within 10 minutes.
4. Create the ability for your application to be use with both a test/sandbox account and a live account for the payments system (e.g. PayPal, Venmo) you select

# Schedule
## Full Schedule
We're starting on May 8th and we're calling August 7th our end.


## Getting started
1. Join the Slack channel for the topic you want to work on
2. Based on the availability of everyone, you may already have people who want to work on this project, if you want to work with a team, say "hi" and join a team.  It may be awkward, but you'll be fine.
3. Once you have formed a team, [create a public Opportunity Hack Slack channel](https://www.google.com/search?q=creating+a+slack+channel&oq=creating+a+slack+channel) and invite your team, then an Issue ticket [here in this GitHub project](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/2020-summer-volunteer-internship/issues/new/choose).  Click on "Get started" and fill out the template - one per team.
4. This ticket is where all of your documentation for the summer will live. For demos, you can either upload a video or link to YouTube, all designs and general discussions will live here.
5. All of your code will go into https://github.com/2020-opportunityhack-voln-internship
   - You will need to Slack us in `#help-github` to ask for a project be created along with the GitHub username or email address we should assign as the owner to this repo.  
   - Once added, you'll receive an email *that you must accept* then you'll be able to add the rest of your team.
6. You should now start researching previous Opportunity Hack DevPost and GitHub submissions (and even Slack history), planning with your team how you'll attack your problem, and get off to the races!

## Agile meetings
### Standups
Every Monday and Wednesday (via Slack).  You'll be messaged by Dixi App every Monday and Wednesday to ask for status.  That status will then be shared in your team's Slack channel for everyone to see once everyone has provided their standup details.  We will be set this up for you after you create the GitHub ticket that declares your team and your project you'll be working on.

Here's an example of what this will look like
![standup](dixi_standup.png)

### Demo meetings
Every 2 weeks on Friday - recorded and published to YouTube.  You'll get a reminder in Slack, and by the end of the day you should have a 4-minute or less video describing your contributions to the project for those 2 weeks.  Each person will create their own demo video.

### Planning meetings
Every 2 weeks on Wednesday.  You should meet with your teams via Google Meet, Zoom, Slack call, or Slack chat to take stock of where you are at now and what needs to be done.  In order to track this work, we'd recommend you use a [Trello board like this](https://trello.com/templates/engineering/agile-sprint-board-ZqN99gGN), but this is completely up to you and your team.

## Mentor "office hours"
- Every week to start for the first 2 weeks
- Switch to 2-week meetings after first 2 weeks
- We'll be using Google Meet and the link will be provided in our `#2020-vol-intern-general` Slack chat
